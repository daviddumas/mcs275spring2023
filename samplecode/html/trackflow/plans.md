# Plans for TrackFlow
The 1pm section application

## Worker view

This view knows which user it is presenting to.

* List of work orders that are assigned to this user
    * Show description of work order and date information?
    * Can click buttons to mark complete or cancel assignment

* List of worker orders not assigned to anyone yet
    * Show description of work order and date information?
    * Can click a button to accept this WO as an assignment

## Concerns

We haven't talked about Python date/time handling in this course.
